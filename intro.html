    <h1>Hello, I'm Krishna Bhavsar!</h1>
    <p>I'm an 18-year-old first-year Mechanical Engineering student, currently exploring the fascinating world of engines and machinery. My passion for mechanical systems extends to a deep love for engines, and I find particular joy in the intricate workings of motorcycles.</p>
    <p>Being a part of the B.Tech program, I am eager to delve into the exciting challenges and learning experiences that Mechanical Engineering has to offer. The roar of engines and the mechanics behind them have always intrigued me, and I am enthusiastic about applying my knowledge and skills to real-world engineering problems.</p>
    <p>When I'm not immersed in my studies, you'll likely find me exploring the latest bike models, tinkering with machines, or engaging in discussions about the ever-evolving world of mechanical engineering. I'm excited about the journey ahead and the opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute to the field!</p>
